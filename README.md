# eBird Crawler

Command Line tool for birdwatchers who use the [eBird App](https://www.ebird.org/home) built with Node.js, Puppeteer, and TypeScript. eBird crawler crawls the Cornell database and iterates through checklist pages. Map data is then extracted and concatenated into a single large map using a Library (Leaflet) on an HTML page.
